   // TODO @ Update (2021-08-10) of EvalSlcXRotationTrafo:
   // ----------------------------------------------------
   //
   // - I did a cursory scan of the literature. There are formulas for Ylm
   //   rotations around, ...but
   //   (a) published ones are usually for complex harmonics. In principle
   //   straight forward to convert, but still nasty.
   //   (b) I found many variants. They are all horrible (Euler angles, Wigner-D
   //   matrices and similar insanities),
   //   (c) I found several published approaches, some with many citations,
   //   which I would consider even WORSE than mine here.
   //
   // - So the equation system variant may not be that bad, after all. In
   //   principle, for the smaller system some symbolic solution should be quite
   //   feasible. But I played around with it for a bit and did not manage to
   //   get Mathematica to produce it in a reasonable form on the first try.
   //   Certainly not in a form scalable to L=8 at least (we use those for
   //   fitting sets)
   //
   // - For the numerical variant, I think we need to replace the SVD with a
   //   basic SVD or LU code (IR really cannot have a LAPACK dependency); I
   //   think I had made one, somewhere, not so long ago.
   //
   // - Regarding the representation of the result:
   //
   //   + Result should probably be represented with a more suitable data
   //     structure than the nSlcX(MaxL)^2 block-diagonal matrix I have here at
   //     the moment.
   //   + ...but I presently do not have a clean overview over where and how
   //     exactly the trafos are used (definitely in IboView, and I think
   //     MicroScf had something like this for initial guess propagation,
   //     somewhere). Need to investigate and update.
   //   + I think a higher meta data structure would be in order, even if
   //     we get sets of (2l+1)^2 block matrices of fixed structure. A little
   //     meta structure to simplify access to them.
   //
   // - Regarding the concrete setup of the equation systems:
   //
   //   + The rotation trafos SHOULD be solved for in the different L
   //     subspaces individually.
   //
   //   + Technically, we just need a set of a sufficient number (2l+1) of
   //     distinct real-space points, and their R-transforms, to derive the
   //     equation system uniquely, following the ideas above.
   //
   //     One such set of 2l+1 distinct points would be:
   //
   //           p_0     = (  l,   0,  0)
   //           p_1     = (l-1,   1,  0)
   //           p_2     = (l-2,   2,  0)
   //           ...       ...
   //           p_l     = (  1, l-1,  0)
   //           p_l     = (  0,   l,  0)
   //           p_{l+1} = (  0, l-1,  1)
   //           p_{l+2} = (  0, l-2,  2)
   //           ...       ...
   //           p_{2l}  = (  0,   0,  l)
   //
   //     - Note that these are points, not vectors. And linear dependence is not
   //       actually a measure, because the S^l_m are not linear functions.
   //     - I guess things like conditioning would still exist, so not all kinds
   //       of point sets would be numerically quite equivalent; but it is hard
   //       to estimate what effect that would have, and what better choices
   //       should look like (apart form normalized points on the unit sphere
   //       probaby being a good idea)
   //
   //   + The transformation T_l  we mean to find is a (2l+1, 2l+1)-shape
   //     matrix, which is supposed to have the following outcome:
   //
   //           S[l,c](R r) = \sum_{c'=0}^{2l} T_l[c,c'] S[l',c'](r)    (A1)
   //
   //     So once we have those trial points, we just use them to set up
   //     multiple rows of (A1), just enough to uniquely determine T:
   //
   //           A_{iRow,iCol} := S[l,iRow](p_{iCol})
   //           B_{iRow,iCol} := S[l,iRow](Râ‹…p_{iCol})
   //
   //           B = T * A
   //           â‡” B^âŠ¹ = A^âŠ¹ * T^âŠ¹
   //
   //     ...and that's what we'd solve for. T = solve(A^âŠ¹, B^âŠ¹)^âŠ¹
   //
   //   + A bit of an issue is that we'd actually get *all* low Ls, too. In the Slc
   //     components. Might need to do something about that. E.g., a different ordering
   //     of the points which can be shared across all Ls. Can that be done?
   //
   //           p_{  0} = (0, 0, 1)
   //           p_{  1} = (1, 0, 0)
   //           p_{  2} = (0, 1, 0)        // <-- L = 1 boundary
   //
   //           p_{  3} = (1, 0, 1)/âˆš2
   //           p_{  4} = (0, 1, 1)/âˆš2     // <-- L = 2 boundary
   //
   //           p_{  5} = (2, 0, 1)/âˆš5
   //           p_{  6} = (0, 2, 1)/âˆš5     // <-- L = 3 boundary
   //
   //           p_{  5} = (3, 0, 1)/âˆš10
   //           p_{  6} = (0, 3, 1)/âˆš10    // <-- L = 4 boundary
   //
   //     ...apparently it can. And it does become clearer what is going on.
   //     Instead of fixing all the z elements, we could also employ the following
   //     variant:
   //
   //           p_{  0} = (0, 0, 1)
   //
   //           p_{  1} = (1, 0, 0)
   //           p_{  2} = (0, 1, 0)        // <-- L = 1 boundary
   //
   //           p_{  3} = (1, 0, 1)/âˆš2
   //           p_{  4} = (0, 1, 1)/âˆš2     // <-- L = 2 boundary
   //
   //           p_{  5} = (1, 0, 2)/âˆš5
   //           p_{  6} = (0, 1, 2)/âˆš5     // <-- L = 3 boundary
   //
   //           p_{  5} = (1, 0, 3)/âˆš10
   //           p_{  6} = (0, 1, 3)/âˆš10    // <-- L = 4 boundary
   //
   //     (note: the sqrts are Sqrt[(L-1)^2 + 1]. I guess just dividing by (L-1)
   //     would also do the trick if I use solid harmonics. But maybe better go
   //     with unit sphere and do full normalization...)
   //
   //   + Well... all in all, this seems quite doable. Need to have a closer
   //     look into how to do the transpositions, though---I get the c/c' components
   //     as rows, but would need them as cols (logical cols, that is, whether
   //     that agrees with the storage order is another matter).
   //     Oops... the code above also does the matrix copy. In my case I'd
   //     need to preserve the original matrices, rather than overriding rhs,
   //     so a copy may anyway be needed.
   //
